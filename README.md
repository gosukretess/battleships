# Battleships in Go âš“

**Battleships** is a simple Battleship game project I created to learn the Go programming language. The application consists of a gRPC server and a terminal-based client using the [`tview`](https://github.com/rivo/tview) library for a clean UI.

The game allows two players to play in real-time using bidirectional streaming. Ships are randomly placed at the start of the game, and players take turns firing shots, which are validated by the server.

## âœ¨ Technologies

- Go 1.24.2
- gRPC + bidirectional streaming
- SQLite
- Google Wire (dependency injection)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Server

```bash
go run ./cmd/server
```

### Client

In a separate terminal:

```bash
go run ./cmd/client
```

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The game supports **two players** and one default game.
- Game state persists between sessions
- Additional users and games can be created using gRPC commands (no UI for this yet).
- Each player is randomly assigned **12 coordinates** where ships are placed.
- The game **does not have a win condition** â€“ it continues indefinitely.
- If a player shoots at a previously targeted coordinate, they are notified and asked to shoot again.
